* [ ] Storing the configuration (maybe each user can have multiple configs?)
* [ ] Could we make a component update it's own height (expandable?)


* Store/configure a default layout for new users. Also defaults based on User Groups?
  * Maybe use a key/value store for stuff? `config_1` = user 1s config, `default_22` default for yada, `html` html for the "html widget". 
* Widget with HTML to save? (Like a edit button, paste HTML and save), global or personal 
* Widget showing log-entries (what about permissions?)
* User-level TODO-widget?
